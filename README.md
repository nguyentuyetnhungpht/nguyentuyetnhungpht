###  ðŸ‘‹ I'm Rem ðŸ‘‹


Yes. YOU :punch:. Let me tell you a small secret.

I can't solve that one motherfucker *easy* problem on HackerRank for an hour in my own room. So if you feel bad about failing an interview because of a tricky algorithm question. Don't. You do not need to grind all those exercises and have stickers on your laptop to be able to build the things like I've done here.

Be more practical. Find some problems you have and write code to solve it. It doesn't need to be fancy, maybe some tasks you do everyday that's slightly inconvenient so you decide to automate it. This is the fastest way to learn a programming language, framework or any technologies that you come across while solving the problem.

Get your fucking hand dirty like after the post-nut clarity, spend hours reading the docs and sometimes expect all of the stackoverflow answers and github issues just lead to a dead-end, so you decide that you no longer want to be a programmer, take a 8-hour nap, wake up, find a different approach and solve the problem 5 minutes later.

Programming has its up and down, it's a lie if I say I never become miserable at times. But one day you take a step down, look back and realize how much different you are to your past self a year before. I promise. It's a very rewarding feeling.

It's also possible to code no more than 4 hours a day and have a life. Yes, it's totally doable. The choice is all yours, you don't need to be a rockstar developer. I don't, I'd rather play Rimworld in my free time and watch Pewdiepie streaming Cyberpunk 2077 for 8 hours a day while witnessing his body slowly deteriorated.

Btw, that HackerRank problem still remains an unsolved mystery to this day.
